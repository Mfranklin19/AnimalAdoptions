# AnimalAdoptions
Animal Adoption application using an SQL database and a java UI


In this project, I was responsible for the following:
	
	- Contributing to the overall design of the database
	
	- Creating the outline for the UI (not adding any functionality to its buttons)
	
	- Writing approx. 1/3 of the stored procedures
